# SFML Utils

A set of utilities for SFML 3.x game development, approximately in the style of the SFML API.

### Features
- Texture atlases
    - Animations
    - Tilemaps
- Post processing render targets
- More mathematical shapes
- Basic camera controllers
- Particle systems (CPU only at present)

### Planned
- Compute shaders
- GPU accelerated particles
- Arbitrary polygon collision
- Curves and curve based geometry

I am not in any way directly affiliated with the SFML project, I just like using it and designing my tools around it.
